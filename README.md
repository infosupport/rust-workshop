# Rust Workshop - Choose your own adventure

Welcome to the Rust workshop. In this workshop, you'll experience how powerful Rust is and what it
takes to build applications with this programming language.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a command-line utility. We will work with a command-line parser,
REST clients, and more.

Before you begin, we recommend reading the introduction below. During the workshop, we'll talk you through the
introduction to give you a more interactive experience.

## Introduction

In the introduction, we explain how Rust works and help you get started quickly with a few concepts. This is not a
complete explanation of the language, but certainly useful for taking the first steps!

- [Why should you learn Rust?](docs/introduction/01-why-should-you-learn-rust.md)
- [Learning the basics of Rust](docs/introduction/02-learning-the-basics-of-rust.md)
- [Memory management in Rust](docs/introduction/03-memory-management-in-rust.md)
- [Pattern matching](docs/introduction/04-pattern-matching.md)
- [Working with structs and traits](docs/introduction/05-working-with-structs-and-traits.md)

## Module Structure

The tutorials are designed so that you can perform them yourself without our help. Each module explains the goal 
with a set of basic instructions. So, if you are already a bit further along or want to discover how it
works, you can start independently with the instructions.

In addition to the basic instructions, we have also included a step-by-step plan. You can follow this to get more
support while learning. We are available during the workshop to help you with questions, so the tutorials should 
be easy to follow, even if you have little programming experience.

We have extended each module with a completed sample. Please feel free to look at the code if you're stuck. 
The explanation for each module has a link to the completed sample.

We've included links to the manual with more background information.
