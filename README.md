# Rust Workshop - Choose your own adventure

Welcome to the Rust workshop. In this workshop, you'll experience how powerful Rust is and what it
takes to build applications with this programming language.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a command-line utility. We will work with a command-line parser,
REST clients, and more.

Before you begin, we recommend reading the introduction below. During the workshop, we'll talk you through the
introduction to give you a more interactive experience.

## üö© Introduction

In the introduction, we explain how Rust works and help you start quickly with a few concepts. This is not a
a complete explanation of the language, but certainly useful for taking the first steps!

## üöÄ Getting started

Done reading? [Get started here](https://github.com/infosupport/rust-workshop/tree/main/cli).

The tutorial covers the basics of Rust. You can choose between a completely self-guided experience and a step-by-step instruction-based approach.
Whatever you choose, we're here to help, and we hope you enjoy the ride!

## üèóÔ∏è Using the Devcontainer

To make setting up the development environment easier, we have provided a dev container configuration with Rust preconfigured. Follow the steps below to use the dev container:

1. Install Docker on your machine if you haven't already.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
3. Install the "Remote - Containers" extension in Visual Studio Code.
4. Press `F1` and select `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...`.
5. Select the root folder of the project.
6. Wait for the container to build and start.

Once the container runs, you will have a fully configured Rust development environment.
