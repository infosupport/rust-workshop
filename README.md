# Rust Workshop - Choose your own adventure

Welcome to the Rust workshop. In this workshop, you'll experience how powerful Rust is and what it
takes to build two kinds of applications. You can follow this workshop in two ways:

- **[Build a REST API with Rust](docs/rest-api-tutorial)**  
  In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of building an HTTP Server with Rust. In this tutorial, you will learn
  how to handle HTTP requests, communicate with a database, and how you can build asynchronous programs in Rust.

- **[Build a command-line tool with Rust](docs/command-line-tutorial)**  
  In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a command-line utility. We will work with a command-line parser,
  REST clients, and more.

Before you begin, we recommend reading the introduction below. During the workshop, we provide explanations. This is
an interactive version of the introduction below.

## Introduction

In the introduction, we explain how Rust works and help you get started quickly with a few concepts. This is not a
complete explanation of the language but certainly useful for taking the first steps!

- [Why should you learn Rust?](docs/introduction/01-why-should-you-learn-rust.md)
- [Learning the basics of Rust](docs/introduction/02-learning-the-basics-of-rust.md)
- [Memory management in Rust](docs/introduction/03-memory-management-in-rust.md)
- [Writing functions in Rust](docs/introduction/04-writing-functions-in-rust.md)
- [Pattern matching](docs/introduction/05-pattern-matching.md)
- [Working with structs and traits](docs/introduction/06-working-with-structs-and-traits.md)

## Module Structure

The tutorials are designed so that you can perform them yourself without our help. Each module contains an explanation
of the goal with a set of basic instructions. So, if you are already a bit further along or want to discover how it
works yourself, you can get started independently with the instructions.

In addition to the basic instructions, we have also included a step-by-step plan. You can follow this to get more
support while learning. We are available during the workshop to help you with questions, so even if you have
little programming experience, the tutorials should be easy to follow.

We have extended each module with a completed sample. Feel free to peek at the code if you're stuck. 
In the explanation for each module, there is a link to the completed sample.

Where necessary, we have included links to the manual with more background information.

## Completed samples

If you're just interested in the final product you can check out the samples in one of these directories:

- [rest-api](./rest-api/)
- TODO: Link to `rest-client` directory
