# Building a CLI with Rust

Welcome to the tutorial! In this tutorial, you'll build your first command-line application in Rust for the [TODO API](../rest-api). 
This will be a simple application that covers some of the basics of building a Rust-based application.

Follow the instructions in this document to understand how to write programs like these.

Towards the end of the document, you'll also find a brief user manual.

## Building a CLI with Rust
There are two ways to proceed through this workshop.

1. You can try the [on my own pace](./on-my-own-1.md) path.
This guide wil give you less detailed instructions and rather point you to relevant documentation.
This means you'll have to figure things out yourself.
It may take longer, but you will probably learn more.

2. Alternatively, you can follow the [step-by-step instructions](./step-by-step-1.md).
This guide will give you detailed instructions about the files to modify and the changes to make.
There will still be pointers to relevant documentation, but you can read them later.
This guide will take you less time, but may require additional studying later to get the same level of understanding.

Whichever path you take: have fun!
